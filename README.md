# 📊 Agile Sprint Analysis: Velocity & Team Performance

This project analyzes real-world Agile sprint data from the **Spring XD open-source project**. It uncovers patterns in **sprint velocity**, **team size**, and **delivery efficiency** over 66 sprints, offering data-driven insights that reflect the mindset of both a **data analyst** and a **project manager**.

## 📁 Dataset Information

- Source: Public Agile Jira Dataset (Spring XD)
- Files used:
  - `Spring XD Issues 1992.csv` — Individual issue-level data
  - `Spring XD Issues Summary 2861.csv` — Sprint-wise summary of story points, bugs, and tasks
  - `Spring XD Sprints 67.csv` — Metadata for each sprint (start/end dates, team size, estimates, completions)

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Analyze sprint velocity over time
- Identify high vs low performing sprints
- Examine the impact of team size on delivery output
- Explore blocker patterns (if any)
- Derive actionable PM-focused insights from real-world sprint data

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Velocity Trend**: Story point completion increased over time, reflecting improved sprint planning and estimation.
- **Team Size Impact**: Sprints with 8–10 developers showed the most consistent delivery performance.
- **Blocked Issues**: No blockers were reported across 1992 issues — indicating either high process efficiency or underreporting.
- **Sprint Drops**: Underperforming sprints had either fewer developers or unusually high initial estimates.
